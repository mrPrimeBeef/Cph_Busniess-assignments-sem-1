/*                Sem: 1 torsdag: 3 Task: 5
Task 5: Compare attribute values of to objects
Create a new sketch for Task5 and copy the files Datamatik.pde and Student.pde 
from the folder Task3 to the folder Task5.

5.a In your tab Datamatik, make a new method called isClassmates(). 
The method should take two Student objects as parameters. The method should 
return a boolean.

5.b Make your method return true, if the team-variable of one of the Student
has the same value as the team-variable of the other Student given as argument
to the method. For example, if both Students are on team "DAT1" or 
team 1 (depending on which data type you have used for the global variable team),
the method should return true. If they are not on the same team, the method should
return false.

5.c From your setup() function in Datamatik, call the method isClassmates() 
with two Student-objects. Make sure that you assign the returnvalue to a variable
in the setup()-method. From setup() print " and are classmates" is they are on the 
same team and " and are not classmates" if they are not.
